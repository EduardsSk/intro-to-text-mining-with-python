programme 2019.
 
## Code details

The aim of the code in this repository is to show basic text mining techniques 
to participants who are complete beginners to both text mining and coding. 
As such, the notebooks are designed to be run as a teaching aid, not as a serious text analysis tool.

The main library used in this repository is:
* [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/) (NLTK)
