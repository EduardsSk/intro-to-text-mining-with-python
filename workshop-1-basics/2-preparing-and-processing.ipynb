    "## 5 Steps of Text-Mining\n",
    "There is no set way to do text-mining, but typically a workflow will involve steps like these:\n",
    "1. Choosing and collecting your data\n",
    "2. Cleaning and preparing your data\n",
    "3. Exploring your data\n",
    "4. Analysing your data\n",
    "5. Presenting the results of your analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You may go through these steps more than once to refine your data and results, and frequently steps may be merged together. The important thing to realise is that steps 1-2 are critical in ensuring your data is capable of actually answering your research questions. You are likely to spend significant time on cleaning and preparing your data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "## More Python Basics\n",

    "Before we start in earnest to code again, we need to cover a few more Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a lot of amazing capabilities built-in to the language itself, like being able to manipulate strings. However, in any Python project you are likely to want to use Python code written by someone else to go beyond the built-in capabilities. Code 'written by someone else' comes in the form of a file (or files) separate to the one you are currently working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "An external Python file (or sometimes groups of files) is called a **module** and in order to use them in your code, you need to **import** it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple process using a **keyword** called `import` and the name of the module. Just make sure that you `import` something _before_ you want to use it!"
