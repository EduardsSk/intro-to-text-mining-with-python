    "## More About Tokenising and Normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last workshop, in notebook `workshop-1-basics/2-collecting-and-preparing.ipynb`, we cleaned and prepared the text _The Iliad of Homer_ (translated by Alexander Pope (1899)) by:\n",
    "* Tokenising the text into individual words.\n",
    "* Normalising the text:\n",
    " * into lowercase,\n",
    " * removing punctuation,\n",
    " * removing non-words (empty strings, numerals, etc.),\n",
    " * removing stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "One form of normalisation we didn't do last time is making sure that different _inflections_ of the same word are counted together. In English, words are modified to express quantity, tense, etc. (i.e. _declension_ and _conjugation_ for those who remember their language lessons!).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 'fish', 'fishes', 'fishy' and 'fishing' are all formed from the root 'fish'. Last workshop, all these words would have been counted as different words, which may or may not be desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stemming and Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to normalise for inflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming** - reducing a word to a stem by removing endings (a **stem** may not be an actual word).\n",
    "* **Lemmatization** - reducing a word to its meaningful base form using its context (a **lemma** is typically a proper word in the language).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we can use several facilities provided by NLTK. There are many different ways to stem and lemmatize words, but we will compare the results of the [Porter Stemmer](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/) and [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) lemmatizer."
